My code should work for all the test cases individually. I struggled to implement
the subshell functions, so right now my code just ignores '(' and ')'s.

Everything else should be correctly handled, except some syntax rules I didn't have
time to implement. For example, \ns are sometimes allowed in places they shouldn't be.
