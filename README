I refactored my part 1a stuff entirely much code is different from my previous 
submission. Specifically, I made sure to design it much more modularly
and deal with tokens rather than trying to parse the whole stream all at once.
The result is much better I think.

My execute command is pretty simple -- it just gets a command_t as input and 
splits off into a sub-process to run it. AND and OR commands split into two
subshells and use their respective logic to decide what to return, where the 
PIPE command uses the linux pipe() call so the commands can share data
between them. 

My test_1b.sh file just tries some basic shell commands and checks that each
control construct is working correctly. Personally I think everything works, but
there may be some underlying bugs.
